# A Deep Hybrid Learning to Detect Bangla Fake News

## Problem Statement
To create an intelligent system for Bangla Fake News Detection

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution to this problem is to create hybrid model. Here, both Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Network used to build this model. The central role of Neual Network is to do feature extraction. To detect a fake news, Machine Learning algorihtms were used.

## Data Description
Dataset available in Kaggle: [BanFakeNews](https://www.kaggle.com/cryptexcode/banfakenews)

In this work, we have used `BanFakeNews` dataset for both trainning and testing.
